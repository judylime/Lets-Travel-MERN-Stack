# lets-travel

This project is all about Node, Express, Mongo, Mongoose, Routing, Templating, Authentication and deployment and moving to the back end of websites

Start off with Node and the Express framework where we set up a travel booking application called letâ€™s travel.

After this, move onto routing and templating.

This allows us to switch between pages and navigate through our app, along with setting up templates to display not just content we have created, but also to render data from databases too.

And databases are what the next section is all about, where we look at MongoDB and Mongoose.

Learn so much including modelling our data, create, read, update and delete actions, along with filtering and aggregation to get back the exact data we need.

After this  push on with styling and adding lots of nice features to our project, along with learning many next generation Javascript techniques from ES6 and beyond.

also learn how to allow users to upload images, and how we can save and retrieve these images from cloud storage.

most apps nowadays need to deal with user accounts and authentication, and this is something we will also learn about while applying all this to our project.

learn how to create user accounts, logging in and out, validating the users information, authentication, storing passwords safely and so much more.

We finish off our app by allowing the user to place orders and save to the database.

Then we create an account are where the user can log in and see any bookings which they have made, and also admin users can go into the admin section too to see a list of all orders from the site.

ends by showing you some security tips and recommendations to prepare your application for production.

then push our app to a live server for the rest of the world to see.

excited to learn about Javascript, Node, Express, Mongo, user accounts and authentication, routing, deployment and so much more,
